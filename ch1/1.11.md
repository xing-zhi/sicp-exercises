The following is the procedure by means of a recursive process.
```scheme
(define (f n)
  (if (< n 3)
      n
      (+ (f (- n 1)) (* 2 (f (- n 2))) (* 3 (f (- n 3))))))
```

The following is the procedure by means of a interatice process.
```scheme
(define (f n)
  (define (iter a b c count)
    (if (= count (+ n 1))
        a
        (iter (+ a (* 2 b) (* 3 c)) a b (+ count 1))))
  (if (< n 3)
      n
      (iter (f 2) (f 1) (f 0) 3)))
```
