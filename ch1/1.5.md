The expression will yield the result 0 if the interpreter uses normal-order evaluation. If the interpreter uses normal-order evaluation, the procedure p will be evaluated only when needed, but the result of the if expression is 0, which is the final result, and the p will never be evaluated.

The interpreter will hang if the interpreter uses applicative-order evaluation. If the interpreter uses applicative-order evaluation, the procedure p will be evaluated before the the evaluation of the if expression, and the procedure p will invoke itself endlessly, which makes the interpreter hang.
