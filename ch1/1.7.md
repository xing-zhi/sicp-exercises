For very small number, if the tolerance is bigger than the square root of the number, it will stop evaluating when the result of `(abs (- (square guess) x))` is smaller than the tolerance, but result is too big. For example, when tolerance is `0.001`, the result of `(sqrt 0.00000001)` is `0.03125000106562499`, but the square root of `0.00000001` is `0.0001`.

For very large number, if the tolerance is very small, the result of `(abs (- (square guess) x))` may never smaller than the tolerance, and the procedure will keep running and never yield the square root. For example, when tolerance is `0.00001`, `(sqrt 90000000000000909009000998911111191)` will keep running.

The square-root procedure using a new good-enough? procedure by watching the change from one iteration from the next.

```scheme
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess (improve guess x))
      (improve guess x)
      (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
(define (good-enough? guess improved)
  (< (abs (- guess improved)) 0.001))
(define (improve guess x)
  (average guess (/ x guess)))
(define (average x y)
  (/ (+ x y) 2))
(define (sqrt x)
  (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))
```

The result of `(sqrt 0.00000001)` is `9.799734463768973e-4` when the tolerance is `0.001`. Though it is not good enough, much better now.

The result of `(sqrt 90000000000000909009000998911111191)` is `300000000000001540` when the tolerance is `0.00001`, the evaluation is very fast and the result is very close.

Now we can conclude that the square-root procedure works better for small and large numbers when use the new good-enough? proceduce by watching the change from one iteration to the next.
